    "> -   Master the core concepts of regex: character classes (e.g.¬†`[a-z]`), quantifiers (`?`, `*`, `+`, `{}`), anchors, and metacharacters  \n",
    "> -   Use Python‚Äôs `re` module functions‚Äîsuch as `findall`, `search`, `match`, `sub`, and `finditer`‚Äîto search, extract, or replace text patterns  \n",
    "> -   Apply regex effectively to tabular data using `pandas` vectorized string methods like `str.contains`, `str.extract`, `str.findall`, `str.replace`, and `str.count`  \n",

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` offers a lot of very useful functionalities for handling textual data. This is one of the reasons for its success in the natural language processing (NLP) community (see the dedicated section).\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters, we sometimes needed to search for basic textual elements. This was possible with the `str.find` method from the `Pandas` package, which is a vectorized version of the basic `find` method. We could also use the basic method directly, especially when performing *web scraping*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this search function quickly reaches its limits. For instance, if we want to find both the singular and plural occurrences of a term, we will need to use the `find` method at least twice. For conjugated verbs, it becomes even more complex, especially if their form changes according to the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "For complicated expressions, it is advisable to use **regular expressions** or *‚Äúregex‚Äù*. This is a feature found in many programming languages. It is a form of grammar that allows for searching for patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the content in this section is an adaptation of the\n",
    "[collaborative documentation on `R` called `utilitR`](https://www.book.utilitr.org/03_fiches_thematiques/fiche_donnees_textuelles#regex) to which I contributed. This chapter also draws from the book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps.html) which presents a very pedagogical chapter on regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the *package* `re` to illustrate our examples of regular expressions. This is the reference package used by `Pandas` in the background to vectorize text searches."

    ">\n",
    "> **Regular expressions (*regex*) are notoriously difficult to master.** There are tools that make working with regular expressions easier.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -   The reference tool for this is \\[https://regex101.com/\\] which allows you to test `regex` in `Python` with an explanation accompanying the test.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -   Similarly, [this site](https://ole.michelsen.dk/tools/regex/) has a cheat sheet at the bottom of the page.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -   The [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) games allow you to learn regular expressions while having fun.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It can be useful to ask assistant AIs, such as `Github Copilot` or `ChatGPT`, for a first version of a regex by explaining the content you want to extract. This can save a lot of time, except when the AI is overconfident and offers you a completely wrong regex‚Ä¶\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular expressions are a tool used to describe a set of possible strings according to a precise syntax, and thus define a `pattern`.** Regular expressions are used, for example, when you want to extract a part of a string or replace a part of a string. A regular expression takes the form of a string, which can contain both literal elements and special characters with logical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `\"ch.+n\"` is a regular expression that describes the following pattern: the literal string `ch`, followed by any string of at least one character (`.+`), followed by the letter `n`. In the string `\"J'ai un chien.\"`, the substring `\"chien\"` matches this pattern. The same goes for `\"chapeau ron\"` in `\"J'ai un chapeau rond\"`. In contrast, in the string `\"La soupe est chaude.\"`, no substring matches this pattern (because no `n` appears after the `ch`).\n",

The number of times is indeterminate: it may not be necessary to intersperse characters before the *n* or it may be necessary to capture several:\n",

    "> Raw strings (`raw string`) are special strings in `Python` that start with `r`. For example, `r\"toto at the beach\"`. They can be useful to prevent escape characters from being interpreted by `Python`. For instance, if you want to search for a string containing a backslash `\\` in a string, you need to use a raw string to prevent the backslash from being interpreted as an escape character (`\\t`, `\\n`, etc.). The tester <https://regex101.com/> also assumes you are using raw strings, so it can be useful to get used to them.\n",
